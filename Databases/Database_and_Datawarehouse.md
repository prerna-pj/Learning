### Data
Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items. Simply put, it's an attribute or property or characteristics of an object.
1. Qualitative Data : 
  - Nominal: Nominal data represents data where order of the data does not represent any meaningful information. eg: Passport no.
  - Ordinal: Order of the data is important for ordinal data. Eg: Grades, Height – tall, medium, short
2. Quantitative:
  - INTERVAL: Interval classification is used where there is no true zero point in the data and division operation does not make sense. Bank balance, temperature.
  - RATIO: Ratio class is applied on the data that has a true "zero" and where division does make sense. Consider revenue, length of time.

### Data Model
The Data model is specified as a collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics and constraints. These models are used to describe the relationship between the entities and their attributes. A data model is a model that describes how data is represented and accessed, usually for a database.
There is the number of data models:
1. Hierarchical data model: The hierarchical model organizes data into a tree-like structure, where each record has a single parent or root.
2. Network model: The network model builds on the hierarchical model by allowing many-to-many relationships between linked records, implying multiple parent records.
3. Relational model: the relational model sorts data into tables, also known as relations, each of which consists of columns and rows
4. Entity-Relationship model: This model captures the relationships between real-world entities much like the network model, but it isn’t as directly tied to the physical structure of the database.
5. Object-oriented database model: This model defines a database as a collection of objects, or reusable software elements, with associated features and methods.
6. Document model
7. Entity-attribute-value model
8. Star schema
9. The object-relational model: This hybrid database model combines the simplicity of the relational model with some of the advanced functionality of the object-oriented database model.

##### Points to remember while creating a data model:
1. Avoid Large Data Models
2. Lack of Clarity or Purpose
3. Reckless violation of Normal Form
